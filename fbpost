In addition to winning an 11th title in WTA Doubles this March, she began the season by hitting her way into the 4th round in Melbourne. Iveta has spent 8 years in the WTA's Top 100, and last year hit her career-high ranking at #25. She plays the 2nd round in Rome tomorrow, so leave your good luck wishes to her here and read on for more on Iveta.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nIveta's Story:\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nWHERE ARE YOU FROM?  \r\nI was born in Most, Czech republic, but I'm living in Prague for 12 years already.\r\n\r\nWHERE ARE YOU NOW?\r\nHome, Prague. Love this city :-)\r\n\r\nHOW OLD ARE YOU? \r\n28 this year, but feel still like teenager, heheh...\r\n\r\nHOW DID YOU GET YOUR START IN TENNIS?\r\nMy father took me to a tennis club when I was 7, and I was doing pretty good... So I started to play a little, nothing serious, just for fun and to have some hobby.\r\n\r\nWHEN DID YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL PLAYER? \r\nI think when I was 12 or 13 of age. I was winning most of the tournaments and really liked to compete! I started to see myself playing Grand Slams one day and dreaming big!\r\n\r\nDID YOU PLAY OTHER SPORTS OR HAVE OTHER INTERESTS BEFORE TENNIS? \r\nNo, tennis was the very first sport I tried...\r\n\r\nWHY IS TENNIS THE PERFECT FIT? \r\nI think there are many factors, but mainly it is the great choice of my parents. To me it is the best sport for a girl and the fact I had a talent and was doing well since the beginning helped a lot. I really appreciate everything my parents have done for me! With their passion and unstoppable support through all those years I can enjoy this very special and interesting life of a tennis player!\r\n \r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nAbout Iveta's Game:\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nDESCRIBE YOUR GAME IN 3 WORDS \r\nBaseline aggressive game.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS YOUR MOST POWERFUL WEAPON? \r\nMost of the people say it is my backhand, but I just love to hit a forehand down the line!\r\n\r\nDO YOU HAVE ANY HABITS, ROUTINES OR SUPERSTITIONS THAT ARE PART OF YOUR GAME? \r\nPre-match routine is always pretty much the same. On court when I win a toss I like to take a receive to break a serve straight away :)  I always bounce the ball 4x before first serve and 2x before second. When I'm winning I like to take a bench on the same side as previous match (so I don't like to go on court as second one, haha!)\r\n\r\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT TENNIS AND BEING ON THE TOUR? \r\nThere is not just one thing. I love to compete, the feeling of winning is like a drug sometimes :) ...play in front of a great crowds at the biggest tournaments...try to get better and push my limits...enjoy the ups and downs as well with my team...to travel around the world, visit new places, see different cultures, meet great people and make new friends!\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE WORDS YOU LIVE BY? \r\nlive * love * laugh\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST WIN OR MOST DEFINING MOMENT IN YOUR CAREER?  \r\nOooooh there is so many great experiences!

I like minimalism combined with designers accessories.\r\n\r\nYOU CHOSE THE OUTFIT YOU‚ÄôRE WEARING IN YOUR PHOTO. WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT IT?  \r\nIt is a typical outfit I like to wear in warm days. And I love my Converse shoes, I have them in every color I think!\r\n\r\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU COULDN‚ÄôT PLAY TENNIS?  \r\nI would try to work in fashion industry or be an actress :)\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR FREE TIME?  \r\nI like to enjoy my free time with family and friends, cause I don't see them very often. And I love to sleep! Morning without alarm ringing is the best!!\r\n\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nIveta's Take on Fashion & Maria Sharapova‚Äôs Collection:\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\nWHAT DO YOU ADMIRE ABOUT Maria Sharapova? \r\nI think she is a great role model on and off the court. One of the top athletes in the world with a huge personality and charisma. Her story is pretty amazing and for sure she inspired millions of people to fight for their dreams! She is also giving back a lot to those who were not that lucky in their lives and trying to help whenever she can! I like her style as well and I think she has a great sense of humor!\r\n\r\nWHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT HER COLLECTION?\r\nIt is very unique collection to me, different from the others. Very feminine, fits perfectly, great material, nice colors that are put together and always with some interesting details! It is important for me to feel comfortable on court with what I'm wearing, but with her collections it is even better! ;) It is high fashion in tennis to me!\r\n\r\nDO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE OUTFIT FROM HER COLLECTION?  \r\nTough question :) I loved her Australian open dress this year, great cut and colors! So far I liked all of the outfits and I'm looking forward to the next ones too! I was lucky to see some lay-outs and I can't wait to wear them!\r\n\r\nWHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN TENNIS APPAREL? WHAT ARE SOME MUST-HAVES?  \r\nIt really has to be comfortable and fit perfectly, so nothing bothers me during play. Material is also important and Nike has the best! And must-haves is a match shirt with long sleeves for cold days or evenings and a pack of wristbands, visors or headbands."}
